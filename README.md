# Pride Badge

A single-page web app written with Vue for generating an embeddable web badge showing one's sexuality, romantic orientation, gender identity, and preferred pronouns.

The options to choose from are listed [here](/optionslist.md). It will display icons and text corresponding to each of these, and you can hover over each one for a definition. The badge will also link back to the website to create your own.
